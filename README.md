fastx
=====

Just a fasta/q parser based on `kseq.h` for CPython and PyPy.

Install with:

    pip install cffi
    pip install fastx

Example use:

    from fastx import Fastx  
    for name, seq, qual in Fastx(filename):
        print(">{}\n{}".format(name, seq))

This library was inspired by the benchmarking page below and that the
existing fastest entry for python works only on CPython. It is not
intended for general use.

Benchmarking
------------

Line profiling the previous code we find program spent as much time adding python
objects together as it does in the pyfastx package:

    34   5682010    2909447.0      0.5     18.9          qlen += qual and len(qual) or 0

```

This modules works both under CPython and PyPy, unlike pyfastx which is
strictly a CPython extension. When using PyPy, the difference between
the Python and C implementation is narrowed dramatically.
